          "Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice" is state of the art epic superhero filmmaking.
          That's a compliment if you prefer these movies to be ponderous, disorganized and glum, 
          but a warning if you prefer tonal variation from film to film and scene to scene, and 
          have a soft spot for storytelling that actually tells, you know, a story, as opposed to 
          doing an occasionally inspired but mostly just competent job of setting up the next chapter 
          in a Marvel-styled franchise.

          Two stars and firm favourites of the action genre, Hrithik Roshan and Tiger Shroff, lock horns in War. 
          It’s a juicy proposition for fanboys and girls of both actors. A sort of millennial throwback to the 
          90s showdown between Sanjay Dutt and Jackie Shroff in Subhash Ghai's Khalnayak. But apart from this 
          talking-point premise, War, serves up a lot more for the action-movie buffs. It has lots of stunts, 
          thrills, twists and just enough masala and explosions to keep you engaged in the first half.

          “Avengers: Endgame” is the culmination of a decade of blockbuster filmmaking, 
          the result of years of work from thousands of people. It is designed to be the 
          most blockbuster of all the blockbusters, a movie with a dozen subplots colliding, 
          and familiar faces from over 20 other movies.  It’s a 
          satisfying end to a chapter of blockbuster history that will be hard to top for pure spectacle. 
          In terms of sheer.

         In India, Baldev is reunited with his relatives and his friend, Ajit. A miserable Simran and her 
         younger sister Chutki take an instant dislike to Simran's fiancé Kuljeet because of his arrogance.
          The next morning, Raj arrives outside of the house where Simran is staying 
         and the two reunite. She begs him to elope with her, but Raj refuses and says he will only marry her 
         with her father's consent. Raj befriends Kuljeet and is quickly accepted by both families.

           Rajnikant's Robot may have pre-dated it, but Ra-One does manage to hold despite the larger-than-life 
           quality of Rajni's antics as Chitti. Here, Shah Rukh Khan does the train walk sideways and he does 
           it rather well. And if that is not enough, the two desi sci fi heroes have a split second encounter 
           on the streets of Mumbai, with Rajni saar showing off his flying googles act and SRK replicating it 
           with elan. Twin Rascals!

          Behold, the first great summer film: a three-hour action-adventure about a leader whose 
          heroic deeds make Conan the Barbarian look like a wimp. The Indian action/period epic "Baahubali 2: 
          The Conclusion" is everything I want but rarely get from superhero and big-budget fantasy movies. 
          Here, larger-than-life characters—specifically a beloved warrior-king Amarendra Baahubali (Prabhas) 
          and his jealous cousin Bhalla (Rana Daggubati)—fight for the Mashimathi.
